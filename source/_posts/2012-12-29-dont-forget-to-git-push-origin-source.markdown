Found some good instructions on how to clone your octopress repo <a href="http://code.dblock.org/octopress-setting-up-a-blog-and-contributing-to-an-existing-one">here</a>: 

Of course, if you didn't {% codeblock %}git push origin source{% endcodeblock %} from the original machine, it's hard to update the blog!
